# Code-of-Conduct

## Introduction
* Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible which includes social economic and want to be very clear about where we stand.
* Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, social economic background or other defining characteristic.
* This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
* We also expect a certain level of resilience in our group. Mediation will be the first option to resolve differences. We all make mistakes and understanding when that is done will be expected. We will not tolerate social media bullying or pressure when comments might be taken out of context. People's carreers could be put on the line by such behaviour. Tolerance also covers acceptance of mistakes or alternative views from people from different political, cultural or religous backgrounds and traditions. We can all screw up occasionally. Let's just accept that.

## Expected Behavior
* Be welcoming.
* Be kind.
* Look out for each other.

## Unacceptable Behavior
* Conduct or speech which is sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, belittling of people of different social economic background or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
* Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
* Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion from whatever political, cultural or regligous tradition.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
