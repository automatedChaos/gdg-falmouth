Welcome to the GDG Falmouth hub. 

## What is a DevFest?

GDG DevFests are large, community-run events that can offer speaker sessions across multiple product areas, all-day hack-a-thons, codelabs, and more. In 2017, the official DevFest Season runs from August 01st through November 30th.

* Here are the key things to do when planning for #DevFest17:
* Create your event on Meetup.com using the word “DevFest” in the description
* Duration of the event should be at least 5 hours
* Ideally more than 1 track if organizing a speaker session based event
* Hackathon - Ideally somewhere between 24-48 hours
* Codelab - Ideally using one of the content bundles in the next few weeks
* Take a look at gContent folder to see brand new bundles
* As always, please consider gender diversity and inclusion in your event plans!
